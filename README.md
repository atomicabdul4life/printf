## Project
> Write  printf function. a task from ALX

## Welcome
This is a rebuild of the standard printf function in C. The printf functions, returns or sends a formatted string to the standard output.

## Description
This team project is part of the ALX Curriculum. It is about printf implementation as it is similar to the C library.

From ALX what we are  expected to learn from this project are as follows:

  - How to use git in a team setting.
  - The complexities of printf.
  - Managing a lot of files and finding a good workflow.

This is a printf function with much more functionalities on  printing characters, strings, octals, hexadecimals (x and X) and a custom binary format.


## Built With
- [UBUNTU](https://ubuntu.com/).
- [GitHub](https://github-dotcom.gateway.web.tr/).

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: **vi**, **vim**,**emacs**
- All your files will be compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
- All your files should end with a new line.
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory.
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
- You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file.
- In the following examples, the main.c files  are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to  your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called main.h.
- Don’t forget to push your header file.
- All your header files should be include guarded.
